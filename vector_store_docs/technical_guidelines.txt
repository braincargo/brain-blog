# BrainCargo Technical Guidelines

## Architecture Principles
1. **Multi-provider Support**: Never depend on a single AI provider
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System should work even if some providers fail
3. **Knowledge Integration**: Use vector stores to enhance AI responses
4. **Testing First**: Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality

## Best Practices
- Always include fallback mechanisms
- Log important operations for debugging
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement health checks for all services

## Vector Store Usage
- Blog generation: Use knowledge for enhanced content
- Categorization: Keep fast, don't use knowledge
- Image generation: Keep creative, don't constrain with knowledge
- Meme generation: Keep spontaneous, don't use knowledge
